It does not take long to learn to play , although obscure situations do arise which require careful interpretation of the rules . The playing time for each individual game is short , so it is often played in matches , for example the first to five points . In short , players are trying to get all of their pieces past their opponent 's pieces . This is difficult because the pieces are scattered at first , and may be blocked or captured by the opponent 's pieces . Each side of the board has a track of twelve adjacent spaces , called points and usually represented by long triangles of alternating -LRB- but meaningless -RRB- color . The points are numbered from 1 to 24 , with checkers always moving from higher-numbered points to lower-numbered points . The two players move their checkers in opposite directions , so the 1-point for one player is the 24-point for the other . Note that the board as shown can be flipped horizontally , with starting positions and direction of play likewise flipped but with no changes to the mechanics of game play . The two orientations are equally common and game boards are all designed to be played both ways . Points one to six , where the player wants to get his pieces to , are called the base . A player may not bear off any checkers unless all of his checkers are in his base . Points seven to twelve are called the outer board , points thirteen to eighteen are the opponent 's outer board , and points nineteen to twenty-four are the opponent 's base .

Setup : Each player starts with fifteen checkers off the board . The players enter their checkers in the opponent 's home board , then bring them around the board as shown in the diagram below . Object : The object of the game is to move all of your checkers around the board to your own home table and then bear them off . The first player to bear off all of his checkers wins the game . To start : Each player rolls one die and the higher number goes first . That player then rolls both dice again to begin his first turn . Entering checkers : You enter a checker by placing it on a point in the opponent 's home board corresponding to a number rolled . For example , if you roll 6-3 , then you enter one checker on the opponent 's six-point and one checker on his three-point . Once you have entered one or more checkers , you may use subsequent rolls to move those checkers forward , to enter more checkers , or both . Movement : The roll of the dice indicates how many points , or pips , the player is to move his checkers . The following rules apply : A checker may be moved only to an open point , one that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers . The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves . For example , if you roll 5 and 3 , you may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open point , or you may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an open point , but only if the intermediate point -LRB- either three or five spaces from the starting point -RRB- is also open .

Count the playing discs to confirm that you have the correct amount . There should be 15 each of two colors , for a total of 30 . Know your terms . The 24 triangular areas on which the discs are initially placed and across which they move are called Points .

The Bar separates the Home Board from the Outer Board . If you 're playing a more serious game , you might use a Doubling Cube , but it has nothing to do with initial setup . Choose which player will use which color . Place five discs of your color on the Point closest to the Bar , yet within the Home Board on your side . Your opponent should do the same on his side .

Contents 1 History 2 Rules 2.1 Sample Game 2.2 Maximum checkers on a point 3 Backgammon as a Gambling Game 4 Computer Backgammon 5 Other games played on the same board 6 External links History Backgammon is the oldest known recorded game in history . Traditionally , it was believed to have originated in ancient Egypt , Sumeria , or Mesopotamia in the Persian empire -LRB- present-day Iran , Iraq , and Syria -RRB- . However , more recent conclusive evidence indicates that the game originated on the eastern borders of Iran , near Afghanistan . Rules Backgammon is a simple game with deep strategic elements . It does not take long to learn to play , although obscure situations do arise which require careful interpretation of the rules . The playing time for each individual game is short , so when it is not played for money it is often played in matches , for example the first to five points . Each side of the board has a track of twelve adjacent points . The tracks are imagined to be connected on one edge of the board , making a continuous chain of twenty-four points . The points are numbered from 1 to 24 , with checkers always moving from higher-numbered points to lo']],\n",

'' - Chernev Basics - Rules and Piece Movement For Each Chess Piece Objective Checkmate : If your opponent 's King is being attacked ergo would be captured on the next move , that 's called `` check . '' If your opponent has no way to save the King from that situation , that 's `` checkmate , '' and you 've won . Tie Games When the King is not in check but there is no legal move left , the game is tied in a stalemate . The game can also be considered a draw if the pieces enter a repetitive cycle of three identicle board positions . For instance , if you move a piece , your opponent threatens , you move back to the previous position with the same piece , and then this whole pattern repeats twice more , the game may be considered a draw . The game may also be drawn By the 50 Move rule : Hence if no pawn moves or captures are made within 50 moves the game may be claimed as a draw due to lack of progress . Movement & Play You and an opponent alternate moves . As a standard White always goes first . All pieces other than Pawns can move either forward or backward . The King : The King can move one adjacent square in any direction diagonal , vertical , or horizontal unless the move would put it in check . It will capture an enemy piece occupying the square it moves into . The King The king may move one square in any direction , including diagonally . In the diagram , the king may move to any square with a purple dot . Queen : The Queen is the most powerful piece . She can move any distance in a straight line , diagonal , vertical , or horizontal , as long as her path is clear . The Queen can not jump over any pieces . She captures a piece by occupying its square . The Queen The queen moves any number of squares horizontally , vertically , or diagonally , but it may not jump over other pieces .

Each player starts the game with one queen , placed in the middle of their first rank next to their king . Beginners often accidentally interchange the placement of the queen and king , thus the mnemonic `` queen on her color . '' The white queen starts on a white square , and the black queen on a black square . In algebraic notation , the white queen starts on d1 and the black queen on d8 . Queens are usually the most mobile pieces in chess . They have the combined powers of a rook and bishop . The queen can be moved in a straight line vertically , horizontally , or diagonally , any number of unoccupied squares as shown to the left , thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop . As with most pieces , the queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits . Ordinarily the queen is slightly more powerful than a rook and a bishop , while slightly less powerful than two rooks . Because the queen is more valuable than any other piece , it is almost always disadvantageous to exchange the queen for a piece other than the enemy 's queen , unless doing so leads to a position where the king can be checkmated . The queen is at her most powerful when the board is open , when the enemy king is not well-defended , or when there are loose -LRB- i.e. undefended -RRB- pieces in the enemy camp . Because of her long range and ability to move in more than one direction , the queen is well-equippe\"],\n",

Daring moves with unique chess pieces are part of a pastime that players have enjoyed for ages . Chess was invented nearly 1,500 years ago and by 1400 AD , the Europeans were so in love with the game that they renamed the chess pieces to represent medieval times . Those chess pieces , each with their own unique abilities and uses , are detailed below . Pawns The eight chess pieces known as pawns represent laborers or serfs , who in medieval Europe were actually considered to be property of wealthy landowners . Laborers were traded like goods or used as diversions during battles in order to protect the landowner . The job of pawn chess pieces is solely to protect higher-ranking chess pieces . Knights Chess sets come with two chess pieces called knights . A medieval knight was a professional solider . In chess , the knights are ranked higher than pawns but their duty is still to protect more important chess pieces and , like the pawn , they are often sacrificed to save the other chess pieces . Rook The rook , sometimes called castle chess pieces , provide a safe refuge , just as castles in ancient times did . Bishops As chess pieces , the bishops represent the church . In medieval times , the clergy were important public figures and were protected by the rest of the citizens . Lower chess pieces keep the bishops safe . Queen During times of kingdoms the queen exerted great influence on the king and often actually held more power than he did . The game of chess mirrors ancient times in that the queen is the most powerful chess piece . King Even though the king is n't the most powerful of\"],\n",

              "    \"Intuitor Chess Instructions for Beginners Chess Instructions for Beginners Introduction The game of chess is over 1300 years old and is one of the most popular games in the world . It has received more total thought time than many great works of art and literature . Like a great work of art , chess is a paradox on many levels . It 's easy to learn but can take a lifetime to master . There are few games which can match its usefulness as a tool for developing mental abilities , yet it 's downright fun . Intuitor.com has provided these online instructions to assist beginners and help promote the outstanding game of chess . Chess is a two-person board game which simulates a battle between two opposing armies . The board has sixty-four squares of alternating colors . Each player has a set of sixteen pieces as shown below . One player will have a set of dark or black pieces and the other a light or white set . These symbolize opposing armies . 8 Pawns 2 Bishops 2 Knights 2 Rooks , or Castles 1 Queen 1 King Moving and capturing : White moves first followed by black . The players continue taking turns using only their own pieces until the game ends . A turn consists of a single act of either moving or capturing . When a piece is moved , it is relocated in the center of a different square . A player can only capture an opponent 's piece , not their own . When a chess piece is captured , it is removed from the board and replaced by the attacking piece . Unlike checkers , multiple captures are not allowed during the same move . Captures are also optional . The exception is when the king is in jeopardy and the only way to save him is to capture a threatening piece . Board Setup The playing board is the battlefield of the game . It 's traditionally oriented so that each player has a white square on the corner to his or her right . The pieces are arranged on the board as shown . Note that the queen always is placed on a square of her own color . figure 1 .

Chess is a turn-based board game for two players , and is one of the most popular games in the world . The goal of the game is to place the opposing king into checkmate , that is , a position in which the king is under attack but can not escape . The game used to be treated as a status symbol of education and aristocracy and in recent times has become to be known as an elitist 's game . Modern international chess has a powerful , sweeping queen who was not a piece provided in the original game . The long reach of bishops today was also lacking at first . Maneuvers such as castling or capturing en passant have been developed within the past few hundred years . Today , chess is one of the most popular board games in the world . International competitions , including world championship events , are organized by an organization called FIDE and American competition organized by the USCF -LRB- United States Chess Federation -RRB- . The only American world champion was Bobby Fischer , although Paul Morphy of Louisiana was likely the strongest player in the world in the 1850s , before a formal world champion was determined . The current world champion is Indian Viswanathan `` Vishy '' Anand .

Pieces are given their value in terms of pawns . For example , most people recognize that a bishop is `` worth '' 3 pawns . We generally do not include a value for the king , since it is never traded during the course of play . We are also taught there there are two types of pieces : `` major '' and `` minor '' pieces . A major piece is one that can deliver checkmate , even if only its friendly king is on the board . Since it is possible to mate with king and rook vs. a lone king , we say that a rook is a major piece . A queen is likewise a major piece . But , since a bishop can not deliver such a checkmate , it is designated as a minor piece . The same is true of a knight : it can not mate a lone enemy king by itself . Therefore , it , too , is considered a minor piece . Now it is true that a bishop and knight can mate an enemy king if they are both on the board , but this is not what we were talking about . Before going any further , a short table of relative piece values is presented below .

              "    \"Tetanus KidsHealth > Parents > Infections > Bacterial & Viral Infections > Tetanus Tetanus , also known as lockjaw , is a serious but preventable disease that affects the body 's muscles and nerves . It typically arises from a skin wound that becomes contaminated by a bacterium called Clostridium tetani , which is often found in soil . Once the bacteria are in the body , they produce a neurotoxin -LRB- a protein that acts as a poison to the body 's nervous system -RRB- known as tetanospasmin that causes muscle spasms . The toxin can travel throughout the body via the bloodstream and lymph system . As it circulates more widely , the toxin interferes with the normal activity of nerves throughout the body , leading to generalized muscle spasms . Without treatment , tetanus can be fatal . In the United States , most cases of tetanus follow a cut or deep puncture injury , such as a wound caused by stepping on a nail . Sometimes the injury is so small the person never even sees a doctor . Injuries that involve dead skin -LRB- such as burns , frostbite , gangrene , or crush injuries -RRB- are more likely to cause tetanus . Wounds contaminated with soil , saliva , or feces -- especially if not properly cleaned -- and skin punctures from nonsterile needles -LRB- such as with drug use or self-performed tattooing or body piercing -RRB- are also at increased risk . Another form of tetanus , neonatal tetanus , occurs in newborns who are delivered in unsanitary conditions , especially if the umbilical cord stump becomes contaminated . Prior to immunizations , neonatal tetanus was much more common in the United States . Now , routine immunizations for tetanus produce antibodies that mothers pass to their unborn babies . These maternal antibodies and sanitary cord-care techniques have made newborn tetanus very rare in developed countries . In fact , tetanus in general is rare in the United States and other nations with tetanus vaccination programs -- fewer than 50 cases of tetanus are reported each year in the United States .

Tetanus , also known as lockjaw , is a bacterial illness that causes very painful muscle spasms . Tetanus is rare in the United States due to widespread vaccine use . Who gets tetanus ? In the United States , tetanus occurs most often in older people . Also at risk for tetanus are farm workers and heroin users . Almost all tetanus cases occur in people who have not been adequately vaccinated against tetanus . How is tetanus spread ? Tetanus occurs when a wound gets contaminated with a bacteria called Clostridium tetani . Tetanus is not spread from one person to another . Where is the tetanus bacteria found ? The tetanus bacteria occurs throughout the environment . It is commonly found in soil contaminated with manure . What are the symptoms of tetanus ? Often the first sign of tetanus is a stiff jaw so that a person can not open their mouth . This is followed by a stiff neck , difficulty swallowing and rigid abdominal muscles . Painful muscle spasms last for several minutes and can involve muscles throughout the body . These spasms can continue for 3-4 weeks . Other symptoms include fever , sweating , and a rapid heart rate . How soon after infection do symptoms occur ? Symptoms usually appear around the 8th day after infection , but they can appear as early as 3 days and as late as months after infection . Does past infection make a person immune ? No . Infection does not guarantee immunity . People who recover from tetanus should still be vaccinated against this disease . What is the treatment for tetanus ? Tetanus immune globulin , antitoxin and antibiotics may be used to treat patients who have tetanus . The wound area should be cleaned , and dead tissue removed . What are the complications associated with tetanus ? Complications can include spasms of the vocal cords , spasms of the muscles used for breathing , broken bones that can occur after severe muscle spasms , high blood'],\n",

These unapproved articles are subject to a disclaimer . -LSB- edit intro -RSB- Tetanus -LRB- or lockjaw -RRB- is a disease whose main symptom is acute muscle spasm ; it is caused by an anaerobic bacterium called Clostridium tetani , found in soil and animal manure . The most common cause of tetanus in developed countries is via an open wound , which becomes infected by spores of the bacteria , often by ordinary soil -LRB- the disease is common , therefore , among farmers and gardeners -RRB- , though body piercing and tattoos can also be responsible . The wound may be very small , and so go unnoticed until the infection becomes more severe . The incubation period varies between two days and a fortnight . The bacteria release a neurotoxin called tetanospasmin which attacks the nervous system , causing fatigue and weakness , and then muscle spasms in the jaw -LRB- hence the disease 's alternative name -RRB- . These symptoms are followed by difficulty in swallowing , by a more general stiffness and spasms of the muscles -LRB- especially in the neck and back -RRB- , perspiration , problems urinating , heightened blood pressure , and a raised heart rate . Without treatment , the disease can be fatal .

Diphtheria , haemophilus influenzae , pertussis , and tetanus are serious diseases caused by bacteria . Diphtheria causes a thick coating in the nose , throat , and airway . It can lead to breathing problems , paralysis , heart failure , or death . Haemophilus influenzae can cause minor flu symptoms or it can cause more serious symptoms such as swelling around the throat , making it hard to swallow or breathe . Haemophilus influenzae can also cause swelling of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord -LRB- meningitis -RRB- . Pertussis -LRB- whooping cough -RRB- causes coughing so severe that it interferes with eating , drinking , or breathing .

Suspect tetanus in cases involving : 1 . Drug addicts 2 . Animal bites 3 . Deep wounds 4 . Home births During trauma , the spores of C. tetani , which are ubiquitous in dust , are injected into the tissue along with other organisms . The aerobic organisms grow initially until the redox potential of the tissue is low . This allows the germination of the clostridial spores and a localized infection results . Proliferating cells elaborate a toxin , tetanospasmin , which causes a systemic toxemia . PATHOLOGY : The tetanospasmin spreads from the infected site to the CNS by two mechanisms : 1 . Adsorption at myoneural junctions followed by migration through perineural tissue spaces of nerve trunks to the CNS . 2 . Passage from tissue spaces to lymphatics , to blood , to the CNS . Regardless of the route , the toxin becomes bound to gangliosides in the CNS . The time consumed in the passage represents the larger part of the incubation period of 2-50 days . This toxin is one of the most potent poisons known . The physiological action is identical to that of strychnine . Both substances suppress inhibiting influences on the motor neurons and interneurons without directly enhancing synaptic excitory action . The toxin also affects synaptic transmission at myoneural junctions . There are no lesions formed in the CNS . DIAGNOSIS : Clues to the diagnosis of tetanus are : 1 . A wound or recent history of a wound 2 . No clear history of tetanus toxoid immunization 3 . Irritability 4 . Restlessness 5 . Headache 6 . Low grade fever or no fever Two basic forms of tetanus may be distinguished : local and general . Local tetanus consists of spasm and increa'],\n",

In the process of trying to free Joe , Steve received numerous punctures to his hands and arms from nails embedded in the collapsed lumber . Both went to the hospital emergency room and were treated for their injuries . The emergency room nurse asked each for a medical history , including how long it had been since his last tetanus booster . Joe had had a booster at his annual physical just six months previously . His gash had bled quite a bit , which had helped to clean out the wound . He was stitched up and told to watch for redness and pus around the stitches . Steve could n't remember how long ago he had had a tetanus shot , but it was probably more than ten years . His deeper punctures were cleaned as well as possible and he was given a tetanus booster -LRB- inactivated tetanus toxin , Td -RRB- and also tetanus immune globulin -LRB- human antibody to tetanus toxin -RRB- . Both Steve and Joe made full recoveries with no symptoms of tetanus . Clostridium tetani is a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium which lives in soil . Under conditions which are not favorable for growth , it forms spores which can survive for long periods , then become vegetative cells when conditions are more favorable . C. tetani grows only in the absence of oxygen , thriving in deep wounds . It is an extracellular pathogen , using enzymes to invade host tissues . C. tetani secretes a neurotoxin which causes the muscle spasms that give tetanus its other name , `` lockjaw '' .

It is caused when the bacterium Clostridium tetani -LRB- pronounced claw-STRID-eeum TEHT-uh-nee -RRB- enters the body . The bacterium often enters the body through wounds or cuts exposed to soil . Tetanus can easily be prevented through vaccination . DESCRIPTION Tetanus is rare in the United States . For many years , a vaccine -LRB- pronounced vak-SEEN -RRB- has been available to protect against the disease and the vast majority of American children receive the vaccine . A vaccine is a substance that causes the body 's immune system to build up resistance to a particular disease . Cases of tetanus usually occur in adults who were never vaccinated against tetanus . Only about one hundred cases of tetanus are reported in the United States each year . Of this number , about 70 percent occur in people over the age of fifty .

The almost constant involvement of the jaw muscles accounts for the popular name of the disease . Spores of Clostridium are distributed widely in nature , especially in soil , and may enter the body through any wound , even a superficial abrasion ; puncture wounds and deep lacerations are particularly dangerous because they provide the oxygen-free environment needed for growth of the microorganism . Both the occurrence and severity of tetanus are determined by the amount of toxin produced and the resistance of the host . The neurotoxic component , tetanospasmin , is one of the deadliest poisons known . It is believed to act on the synthesis and liberation of acetylcholine , a substance having a key role in the synaptic transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body . Once it has entered the body , the toxin rapidly spreads by way of the bloodstream or directly by a nerve to the central nervous system , where it attacks motor nerve cells and excites them to overactivity . Excessive impulses rush through the nerves to the muscles , which are thrown into severe convulsive spasm . The most common spasms occur in the muscle of the jaw , and the first sign of the illness often is stiffness of the jaw , or trismus . The muscles of the mouth are often affected , pulling the lips out and up over the teeth into a grimace , the mixture of smile and snarl that heralds the onset of the gen'],\n",

If you have ever considered skipping that Tetanus shot , re-consider your decision . That shot is your best defense against a life-threatening disease that is hard to prevent and treat . Even if treatment is successful , the disease itself can be extremely painful and may cause serious damage to your body . Keep the following information in mind next time when its time for your Tetanus shot . What is Tetanus ? Tetanus is a disease caused by a bacterium known as Clostridium tetani . This bacterium is normally found in soil and animal feces but is also present in other places as well . Normally , you wouldnt have to worry about the bacterium . However , if its spores make their way into a wound in your body , they will begin production of a toxin substance known as tetanospasmin that will cause problems in your nerves that are able to control the muscles of your body . What are the Symptoms of Tetanus ? You may begin to see signs of an infection in a few days or you may have to wait for a couple of weeks . The average time is eight days . After that period , youll begin to have serious symptoms . These include muscle spasms in your jaw and neck . These spasms can be very strong and painful . As the toxin progresses through your body , you may also begin having spasms in your chest , back , and abdomen . When the spasms start affecting the respiratory muscles in your chest , you may find breathing difficult . Additionally , the spasms may give way to stiffness which can make it almost impossible for you to swallow . You may have heard of this symptom which is known as lockjaw . Often these symptoms are accompanied by fever . How is Tetanus Treated ? When you are diagnosed with Tetanus , your physician will probably use medications to treat the disease . Youll be given an antitoxin to fight the tetanospasmin and an antibiotic to combat the bacterial infection . However , treatment is not always effective . Becau\"],\n",

KEYWORDS for searching the Internet and other reference sources Clostridium tetani Lockjaw Tetanospasmin Trismus What Is Tetanus ? Tetanus is a disease caused by infection with Clostridium tetani -LRB- klos-TRIH-dee-um teh-TAH-nye -RRB- bacteria , which are found all over the world in soil , dust , and some animal feces -LRB- FEE-seez , or bowel movements -RRB- and even on human skin . The bacteria can enter the body through any type of wound , such as a scratch or deep cut . Infection begins after bacterial spores * have moved deep within the body and become active . Clostridium tetani bacteria are anaerobic -LRB- ah-nuh-RO-bik -RRB- , meaning that they grow best in places with very little oxygen -- so the deeper they travel into the body , the better their chances to survive . Once tetanus spores become active , the bacteria begin producing a toxin -LRB- a poisonous substance -RRB- called tetanospasmin -LRB- teh-tuh-no-SPAZ-min -RRB- , which attaches to the nerves around the area of the wound . The tetanus toxin also can spread and attach to the ends of nerves of the spinal cord and at neuromuscular junctions -LRB- where nerves meet muscles -RRB- . The toxin blocks the release of a neurotransmitter -LRB- nur-o-trans-MIH-ter -RRB- , a chemical that carries a signal from nerves to other nerves or muscles . This affects the messages that the muscles receive , resulting in severe muscle spasms * that can be powerful enough to tear muscles apart . There are three types of tetanus infection .

            "20 Chess Basics : Learn The Game of Chess | DJ Emir Mixtapes Chess Lessons Next : Tactics The Essence of Chess The Royal Game of Chess `` Every chess master was once a beginner . '' - Chernev Basics - Rules and Piece Movement For Each Chess Piece Objective Checkmate : If your opponent 's King is being attacked ergo would be captured on the next move , that 's called `` check . '' If your opponent has no way to save the King from that situation , that 's `` checkmate , '' and you 've won . Tie Games When the King is not in check but there is no legal move left , the game is tied in a stalemate . The game can also be considered a draw if the pieces enter a repetitive cycle of three identicle board positions . For instance , if you move a piece , your opponent threatens , you move back to the previous position with the same piece , and then this whole pattern repeats twice more , the game may be considered a draw . The game may also be drawn By the 50 Move rule : Hence if no pawn moves or captures are made within 50 moves the game may be claimed as a draw due to lack of progress . Movement & Play You and an opponent alternate moves . As a standard White always goes first . All pieces other than Pawns can move either forward or backward . The King : The King can move one adjacent square in any direction diagonal , vertical , or horizontal unless the move would put it in check . It will capture an enemy piece occupying the square it moves into . The King The king may move one square in any direction , including diagonally . In the diagram , the king may move to any square with a purple dot . Queen : The Queen is the most powerful piece . She can move any distance in a straight line , diagonal , vertical , or horizontal , as long as her path is clear . The Queen can not jump over any pieces . She captures a piece by occupying its square . The Queen The queen moves any number of squares horizontally , vertically , or diagonally , but it may not jump over other pieces . Rook : The Rook is second in power to the Queen in mos\n",

Each player starts the game with one queen , placed in the middle of their first rank next to their king . Beginners often accidentally interchange the placement of the queen and king , thus the mnemonic `` queen on her color . '' The white queen starts on a white square , and the black queen on a black square . In algebraic notation , the white queen starts on d1 and the black queen on d8 . Queens are usually the most mobile pieces in chess . They have the combined powers of a rook and bishop . The queen can be moved in a straight line vertically , horizontally , or diagonally , any number of unoccupied squares as shown to the left , thus combining the moves of the rook and bishop . As with most pieces , the queen captures by occupying the square on which an enemy piece sits . Ordinarily the queen is slightly more powerful than a rook and a bishop , while slightly less powerful than two rooks . Because the queen is more valuable than any other piece , it is almost always disadvantageous to exchange the queen for a piece other than the enemy 's queen , unless doing so leads to a position where the king can be checkmated . The queen is at her most powerful when the board is open , when the enemy king is not well-defended , or when there are loose -LRB- i.e. undefended -RRB- pieces in the enemy camp . Because of her long range and ability to move in more than one direction , the queen is well-equippe\n",

Daring moves with unique chess pieces are part of a pastime that players have enjoyed for ages . Chess was invented nearly 1,500 years ago and by 1400 AD , the Europeans were so in love with the game that they renamed the chess pieces to represent medieval times . Those chess pieces , each with their own unique abilities and uses , are detailed below . Pawns The eight chess pieces known as pawns represent laborers or serfs , who in medieval Europe were actually considered to be property of wealthy landowners . Laborers were traded like goods or used as diversions during battles in order to protect the landowner . The job of pawn chess pieces is solely to protect higher-ranking chess pieces . Knights Chess sets come with two chess pieces called knights . A medieval knight was a professional solider . In chess , the knights are ranked higher than pawns but their duty is still to protect more important chess pieces and , like the pawn , they are often sacrificed to save the other chess pieces . Rook The rook , sometimes called castle chess pieces , provide a safe refuge , just as castles in ancient times did . Bishops As chess pieces , the bishops represent the church . In medieval times , the clergy were important public figures and were protected by the rest of the citizens . Lower chess pieces keep the bishops safe . Queen During times of kingdoms the queen exerted great influence on the king and often actually held more power than he did . The game of chess mirrors ancient times in that the queen is the most powerful chess piece . King Even though the king is n't the most powerful of\n",

            "20 Intuitor Chess Instructions for Beginners Chess Instructions for Beginners Introduction The game of chess is over 1300 years old and is one of the most popular games in the world . It has received more total thought time than many great works of art and literature . Like a great work of art , chess is a paradox on many levels . It 's easy to learn but can take a lifetime to master . There are few games which can match its usefulness as a tool for developing mental abilities , yet it 's downright fun . Intuitor.com has provided these online instructions to assist beginners and help promote the outstanding game of chess . Chess is a two-person board game which simulates a battle between two opposing armies . The board has sixty-four squares of alternating colors . Each player has a set of sixteen pieces as shown below . One player will have a set of dark or black pieces and the other a light or white set . These symbolize opposing armies . 8 Pawns 2 Bishops 2 Knights 2 Rooks , or Castles 1 Queen 1 King Moving and capturing : White moves first followed by black . The players continue taking turns using only their own pieces until the game ends . A turn consists of a single act of either moving or capturing . When a piece is moved , it is relocated in the center of a different square . A player can only capture an opponent 's piece , not their own . When a chess piece is captured , it is removed from the board and replaced by the attacking piece . Unlike checkers , multiple captures are not allowed during the same move . Captures are also optional . The exception is when the king is in jeopardy and the only way to save him is to capture a threatening piece . Board Setup The playing board is the battlefield of the game . It 's traditionally oriented so that each player has a white square on the corner to his or her right . The pieces are arranged on the board as shown . Note that the queen always is placed on a square of her own color . figure 1 .

Chess is a turn-based board game for two players , and is one of the most popular games in the world . The goal of the game is to place the opposing king into checkmate , that is , a position in which the king is under attack but can not escape . The game used to be treated as a status symbol of education and aristocracy and in recent times has become to be known as an elitist 's game . Modern international chess has a powerful , sweeping queen who was not a piece provided in the original game . The long reach of bishops today was also lacking at first . Maneuvers such as castling or capturing en passant have been developed within the past few hundred years . Today , chess is one of the most popular board games in the world . International competitions , including world championship events , are organized by an organization called FIDE and American competition organized by the USCF -LRB- United States Chess Federation -RRB- . The only American world champion was Bobby Fischer , although Paul Morphy of Louisiana was likely the strongest player in the world in the 1850s , before a formal world champion was determined .

Gothic Chess Software About Gothic Vortex Download A Free Copy Buy A Very Strong Version Other Gothic Chess Programs Gothic Chess Sets Standard Tournament Edition House of Staunton Boards Gothic Chess Games Replay Great Games Greatest Games as Movies Computer World Championships Live Online Archive BrainKing Archive Openings Endings Overview of Piece Values On the regular 8x8 chessboard , we are taught there are three kinds of material : pieces , pawns , and the kings . Pieces are given their value in terms of pawns . For example , most people recognize that a bishop is `` worth '' 3 pawns . We generally do not include a value for the king , since it is never traded during the course of play . We are also taught there there are two types of pieces : `` major '' and `` minor '' pieces . A major piece is one that can deliver checkmate , even if only its friendly king is on the board . Since it is possible to mate with king and rook vs. a lone king , we say that a rook is a major piece . A queen is likewise a major piece . But , since a bishop can not deliver such a checkmate , it is designated as a minor piece . The same is true of a knight : it can not mate a lone enemy king by itself . Therefore , it , too , is considered a minor piece . Now it is true that a bishop and knight can mate an enemy king if they are both on the board , but this is not what we were talking about . Before going any further , a short table of relative piece values is presented below .

In chess , a tactic refers to a short sequence of moves which limits the opponent 's options and may result in tangible gain . Tactics are usually contrasted to strategy , in which advantages take longer to be realized , and the opponent is less constrained in responding -LSB- 1 -RSB- . The fundamental building blocks of tactics are two-move sequences in which the first move poses a double threat . The opponent is unable to respond to both threats in one move , so the first player realizes an advantage on the second move . This includes forks , skewers , batteries , discovered attacks , x-ray attacks , undermining , overloading , deflection , and interference -LSB- 2 -RSB- . Pins also fall into this category to some extent , although it is common for a defending player to relieve neither of the two threats posed by a pin , in which case the attacking player commonly maintains the pin for a longer period of time . A pin is therefore sometimes more strategic than tactical . Often tactics of several types are conjoined in a combination . A combination , while still constraining the opponent 's responses , takes several moves to obtain an advantage , and thus is considered deeper and more spectacular than the basic tactics listed above . Chess computers are considered superhuman at tactics , but rather spotty at strategy . Computers do not think about tactics in human terms -LRB- fork , skewer , etc. -RRB- ; rather , they apply very simple rules to evaluate hundreds of thousands of sequences , the vast majority of which are spurious .
