It does not take long to learn to play , although obscure situations do arise which require careful interpretation of the rules . The playing time for each individual game is short , so it is often played in matches , for example the first to five points . In short , players are trying to get all of their pieces past their opponent 's pieces . This is difficult because the pieces are scattered at first , and may be blocked or captured by the opponent 's pieces . Each side of the board has a track of twelve adjacent spaces , called points and usually represented by long triangles of alternating -LRB- but meaningless -RRB- color . The points are numbered from 1 to 24 , with checkers always moving from higher-numbered points to lower-numbered points . The two players move their checkers in opposite directions , so the 1-point for one player is the 24-point for the other . Note that the board as shown can be flipped horizontally , with starting positions and direction of play likewise flipped but with no changes to the mechanics of game play . The two orientations are equally common and game boards are all designed to be played both ways . Points one to six , where the player wants to get his pieces to , are called the base . A player may not bear off any checkers unless all of his checkers are in his base . Points seven to twelve are called the outer board , points thirteen to eighteen are the opponent 's outer board , and points nineteen to twenty-four are the opponent 's base .

Setup : Each player starts with fifteen checkers off the board . The players enter their checkers in the opponent 's home board , then bring them around the board as shown in the diagram below . Object : The object of the game is to move all of your checkers around the board to your own home table and then bear them off . The first player to bear off all of his checkers wins the game . To start : Each player rolls one die and the higher number goes first . That player then rolls both dice again to begin his first turn . Entering checkers : You enter a checker by placing it on a point in the opponent 's home board corresponding to a number rolled . For example , if you roll 6-3 , then you enter one checker on the opponent 's six-point and one checker on his three-point . Once you have entered one or more checkers , you may use subsequent rolls to move those checkers forward , to enter more checkers , or both . Movement : The roll of the dice indicates how many points , or pips , the player is to move his checkers . The following rules apply : A checker may be moved only to an open point , one that is not occupied by two or more opposing checkers . The numbers on the two dice constitute separate moves . For example , if you roll 5 and 3 , you may move one checker five spaces to an open point and another checker three spaces to an open point , or you may move the one checker a total of eight spaces to an open point , but only if the intermediate point -LRB- either three or five spaces from the starting point -RRB- is also open .

Count the playing discs to confirm that you have the correct amount . There should be 15 each of two colors , for a total of 30 . Know your terms . The 24 triangular areas on which the discs are initially placed and across which they move are called Points . The Home Board is that half which includes both players ' home areas -LRB- this could be on your left or your right , depending which color you 're playing -RRB- . The other half is the Outer Board . The Bar separates the Home Board from the Outer Board . If you 're playing a more serious game , you might use a Doubling Cube , but it has nothing to do with initial setup . Choose which player will use which color . Place five discs of your color on the Point closest to the Bar , yet within the Home Board on your side . Your opponent should do the same on his side . Place two discs of your color on the Point farthest from the Bar , and within the Home Board on your opponent 's side . Your opponent should do the same on your side .
